# AstroNbodySim.jl

Aå¹´astrophysical simulation code library under GPL 3.0

## Installation

```julia
]add AstroNbodySim
```
or
```julia
]add https://github.com/JuliaAstroSim/AstroNbodySim.jl
```

**You might need to install [NVIDIA CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)**

## Package Features

- Compute with units
- User-friendly
  - Well documented
  - Readable programming
  - Vectorized array operations
  - Dispatch on types for various simulation settings
  - `Float16`, `Float32`, `Float64`, `Int128`, `BigFloat`, `Measurement`, etc.
- Cross-platform: `Linux`, `Windows`, `MacOS`. Easy to deploy
- Hybrid Parallelism: multi-threading, distributed parallelism, GPU acceleration
- Modularity and Versatility: 10+ packages, designed for general purposes, highly extentable
- Realtime visualzation (interactive)
- Auto-test workflow

## Development Guide

1. It is highly recommended to use latest `master` branch of related packages (in JuliaAstroSim), first clone:
   - [ParallelOperations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstroSim/ParallelOperations.jl)
   - [PhysicalParticles.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstroSim/PhysicalParticles.jl)
   - [AstroIO.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstroSim/AstroIO.jl)
   - [AstroIC.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstroSim/AstroIC.jl)
   - [PhysicalTrees.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstroSim/PhysicalTrees.jl)
   - [PhysicalMeshes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstroSim/PhysicalMeshes.jl)
   - [AstroPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstroSim/AstroPlot.jl)
2. `dev --local [absolute path]` to install packages mentioned above, for example
   ```jl
   pkg> dev --local /home/user/work/AstroNbodySim
   ```
3. `VS Code` as well as its `Julia Extension` is convenient to use, and `Revise.jl` will update changes on the run.

## First Time User Guide

0. Read documentation of `Julia`: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/
1. Read documentations and READMEs of related packages
2. Try examples in `AstroNbodySim/examples`. First install packages used in examples by `AstroNbodySim/examples/install_pkgs.jl`.
   The default output directory of all examples is `./output`. The programme would make a directory if the user-defined output path does not exist to avoid unnecessary errors.
3. To interrupt a running simulation, create a file named `stop` in the output directory (same with Gadget2):
   ```sh
   echo > output/stop
   ```
4. It's convenient to check out supported function arguments and keywords by `help?` in `REPL`, for example,
   ```julia
   help?> prepare
   search: prepare preprocessdata

     function prepare(simulation::Simulation)

     Do the following operations:
     1. Say hello
     2. Preprocess data
     3. Check the output directory, make a new one if not exist
     4. Remove "stop" file
     5. Set the global preferred units
     6. Set up logging, timing, profiling and analyzing log files
   ```
